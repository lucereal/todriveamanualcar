# How To Drive a Manual Vehicle

### Pre-requisites 

- There are three pedals from left to right: `clutch, brake, and gas`
- The `clutch` controls shifting the gears, which is usually done for you by an automatic vehicle
- The `shifter`, usually in the center console area, is a stick which lines and numbers on the knob of it. This is used to perform the gear shifting
- The `e-brake`, emergency brake, is in all cars but in a manual vehicle it can be considered the vehicles park option. It should always be activated when the vehicle is off or when you want the vehicle to stay without pressing the main brake. 
- The `RPM gauge`, rotations per minute gauge, is how fast the vehicle engine is going based on the gear. This will be used to know when to switch between gears.
